### 3. Google Meet Integration
- **Automatic Meeting Link Generation:**

  - Uses Google Calendar API to create calendar events with Meet links
  - Meeting invites are sent to both mentor and mentee emails

- **Configuration:**
  - Set `GOOGLE_MEET_ENABLED=true` in environment variables to enable
  - Requires Google Calendar API credentials and OAuth setup

### 4. SMS Notifications
- **Twilio Integration:**
  - SMS notifications sent for various events:
    - Password reset verification codes
    - New mentoring requests to mentors
    - Request acceptance/rejection notifications
    - Session scheduling confirmations
  
- **Configuration:**
  - Set `SMS_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=true` to enable
  - Requires Twilio account credentials

### 5. Database Schema Updates
- Added `password_reset_tokens` table
- Added `meeting_link` field to `connection_requests` table
- Added `notifications` table for logging SMS notifications
- Updated `mentors` and `mentees` tables to match server expectations

## New Environment Variables

```bash
# Google Meet Integration
GOOGLE_MEET_ENABLED=false
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback

# Twilio SMS Configuration
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your-twilio-account-sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-twilio-auth-token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your-twilio-phone-number
SMS_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=false
```

## API Endpoints Added

### Password Reset
- `POST /api/forgot-password`
  - Body: `{ email, mobile, userType }`
  - Sends verification code via SMS
  
- `POST /api/reset-password`
  - Body: `{ token, code, newPassword, userType }`
  - Resets password with verification code

### Enhanced Connection Requests
- Updated `POST /api/connection-request` to include:
  - Automatic Google Meet link generation
  - SMS notifications to both parties
  
- Updated `PUT /api/connection-request/:id` to include:
  - SMS notifications for acceptance/rejection
  - Enhanced session creation with meeting links

## How It Works

### 1. Connection Request Flow
1. Mentee sends request → Google Meet link auto-generated (if enabled)
2. SMS sent to mentor about new request
3. SMS sent to mentee confirming request sent
4. When mentor accepts → SMS sent to both parties with meeting details
5. Calendar invites sent via Google Calendar API

### 2. Password Reset Flow
1. User enters email + mobile number
2. System verifies user exists with matching details
3. 6-digit verification code sent via SMS
4. User enters code + new password
5. Password updated in database
6. SMS token marked as used

### 3. SMS Notifications
All SMS notifications are logged in the `notifications` table for tracking and debugging.

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Setup Environment:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Fill in your API credentials
   npm install
   npm run init-db
   ```

2. **Enable Features:**
   - For SMS: Set Twilio credentials and `SMS_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=true`
   - For Google Meet: Set Google credentials and `GOOGLE_MEET_ENABLED=true`

3. **Test Forgot Password:**
   - Go to login page → Click "Forgot Password?"
   - Enter registered email + mobile number
   - Check mobile for verification code
   - Enter code + new password

4. **Test Connection Requests:**
   - Create mentee and mentor accounts
   - Send mentoring request with preferred time
   - Check if Google Meet link is generated
   - Check SMS notifications on both phones
   - Accept/reject request and verify notifications

## Notes

- SMS and Google Meet features are optional and can be disabled
- The system gracefully handles API failures (continues working without notifications)
- All sensitive operations are logged for debugging
- Phone numbers should be in international format (+91XXXXXXXXXX)
- Google Calendar API requires OAuth consent screen setup for production
