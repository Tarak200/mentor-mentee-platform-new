# üîß Login Fix Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ **Issue Fixed**
The login system now correctly respects the user type selection when you have the same email registered as both mentor and mentee.

## üß™ **How to Test the Fix**

### 1. **Stop and Restart Server**
```bash
# Stop existing server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart
npm start
```

### 2. **Clear Browser Data**
- Clear localStorage and cookies to start fresh
- Or open an incognito/private window

### 3. **Test the Fixed Login Flow**

#### **Step A: Go to Homepage**
1. Open: `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click **"I'm a Mentee"** button
3. You'll be redirected to login page

#### **Step B: Verify Login Page**
You should now see:
- **User Type Indicator** showing "Logging in as: Mentee"
- **Red badge** for Mentee
- **Switch to Mentor** button

#### **Step C: Test Mentee Login**
1. Make sure it shows "Logging in as: **Mentee**"
2. Enter your email and password (same credentials for both accounts)
3. Click **Sign In**
4. You should be redirected to **MENTEE DASHBOARD** (red theme)

#### **Step D: Test Mentor Login**
1. Go back to homepage: `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click **"I'm a Mentor"** button
3. On login page, verify it shows "Logging in as: **Mentor**"
4. **Blue badge** for Mentor
5. Enter same email and password
6. Click **Sign In**  
7. You should be redirected to **MENTOR DASHBOARD** (blue theme)

#### **Step E: Test User Type Switching**
1. On the login page, you can click **"Switch to Mentor/Mentee"** button
2. This toggles between mentor and mentee login modes
3. The badge color and text will change accordingly

## üéØ **Expected Results**

### ‚úÖ **When Logging in as Mentee:**
- Login page shows: **"Logging in as: Mentee"** with red badge
- After login: **MENTEE DASHBOARD** with red theme
- Features: Find Mentors, My Sessions, My Profile
- Search bar for finding mentors
- Connect with mentors functionality

### ‚úÖ **When Logging in as Mentor:**  
- Login page shows: **"Logging in as: Mentor"** with blue badge
- After login: **MENTOR DASHBOARD** with blue theme
- Features: Connection Requests, My Sessions, Earnings, Profile
- View mentee requests and accept/reject functionality

## üö® **If Still Having Issues**

### Manual Reset:
```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
// Then refresh page and try again
```

### Direct URL Test:
1. **For Mentee**: `http://localhost:3000/mentee-dashboard`
2. **For Mentor**: `http://localhost:3000/mentor-dashboard`

### Force User Type:
```javascript
// In browser console for mentee:
localStorage.setItem('selectedUserType', 'mentee');

// In browser console for mentor:  
localStorage.setItem('selectedUserType', 'mentor');
```

## üîç **What Was Changed**

1. **Server-side**: Login API now checks the `userType` parameter and looks in the correct table first
2. **Client-side**: Login form now sends the selected user type with credentials
3. **UI Enhancement**: Added visual indicator showing which user type you're logging in as
4. **User Type Switching**: Added ability to switch between mentor/mentee login on the same page

## üéâ **Success Indicators**

- ‚úÖ Same email can login as both mentor and mentee based on selection
- ‚úÖ Login page clearly shows which user type is selected
- ‚úÖ Mentee login ‚Üí Red mentee dashboard with mentor search
- ‚úÖ Mentor login ‚Üí Blue mentor dashboard with mentee requests
- ‚úÖ No more confusion between user types

The fix ensures that your user type selection (from homepage or toggle) determines which dashboard you access, even with the same email credentials! üöÄ
